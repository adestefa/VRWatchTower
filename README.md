Virtual Reality Archery Defense Game


In my studies of Unity 5, Blender and SteamVR, I decided to begin the core elements for a new game.

I love the archery challenge of QuiVR, a wonderful multiplayer game. I also love the castle defense of Longbow (The Lab) another great title. 

I have so many gameplay ideas I would love to explore I decided to get to work. First some basic elements I can use to design levels. 

v0.1 9/19/2016
- Simple scene for testing
- Purchase ememy models and animations
  - add coliders to each weapon
  - add hit detection and health
- Tower temp model to defend
  - add healthbar and script controller
- Simple chase AI I can reuse for each moster, assign any target, including the player.
- Simple animation controller that supports initial states:
   - walk
   - idle
   - attack
- Temp sound effects
  - attack
  - tower destruction
