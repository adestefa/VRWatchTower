Virtual Reality Archery Defense Game


In my studies of Unity 5, Blender and SteamVR, I started to combine what I have learne into a new game.

I love the archery challenge of QuiVR, a wonderful multiplayer game. I also love the castle defense of Longbow (The Lab) another great title. 

I have so many gameplay ideas I would love to explore I decided to get to work.
